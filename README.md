Seperate parts of the project are functional independent of one another. You can run the twitter script on different words and it will be linguistically analyzed. The front-end is built to display the information in a nice wordcloud. As described in the documentation, we were unable to connect the two parts, so the current functionality displays inputed text in a worldcloud.
